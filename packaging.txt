For PATH convenience, in ~/.bashrc:
alias startconda='export PATH=~/"anaconda3/bin:$PATH"'

To build and install the package:
rm -r dist build
python setup.py bdist_wheel
pip install -U dist/*.whl

To make icons if you haven't already:
oct_make_icons

At this point, test the software. We need to write a series of test cases,
especially as we don't have any automated tests.

To release a new version and upgrade to it (test server):
Update the version number in setup.py
rm -r dist build &&
python setup.py bdist_wheel &&
twine upload -u ctroein --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/* &&
pip install -U --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple octavvs-ctroein

To release a new version and upgrade to it:
Update the version number in setup.py
rm -r dist build &&
python setup.py bdist_wheel && 
twine upload -u ctroein dist/* &&
pip install -U octavvs
