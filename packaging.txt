For PATH convenience, in ~/.bashrc:
alias startconda='export PATH=~/"anaconda3/bin:$PATH"'

To only build and pip-install the package locally, use
./inst-local.sh

To make icons if you haven't already:
oct_make_icons

At this point, test the software. We need to create a series of test cases,
especially as we don't have any automated tests.

To build and release a new version and upgrade to it:
Update the version number in setup.py
rm -rf dist build && python setup.py bdist_wheel sdist && twine upload -u ctroein dist/* && sleep 5 && pip install -U octavvs

To build the conda package (after the above):
conda-build --numpy=1.17 conda
Follow the instructions to upload
conda build clean
