To build and install the package:
rm -r dist build
PATH=~/anaconda3/bin/:$PATH python setup.py bdist_wheel
PATH=~/anaconda3/bin/:$PATH pip install -U dist/*.whl

To make icons if you haven't already:
PATH=~/anaconda3/bin/:$PATH oct_make_icons

At this point, test the software. We need to write a series of test cases, especially as we don't have any automated tests.


To release a new version and upgrade to it (test server):
Update the version number in setup.py
rm -r dist build
PATH=~/anaconda3/bin/:$PATH python setup.py bdist_wheel
PATH=~/anaconda3/bin/:$PATH twine upload -u ctroein --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*
PATH=~/anaconda3/bin/:$PATH pip install -U --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple octavvs-ctroein

To release a new version and upgrade to it:
Update the version number in setup.py
rm -r dist build
PATH=~/anaconda3/bin/:$PATH python setup.py bdist_wheel
PATH=~/anaconda3/bin/:$PATH twine upload -u ctroein dist/*
PATH=~/anaconda3/bin/:$PATH pip install -U octavvs-ctroein
